<p>Bash, short for "Bourne Again Shell", is a command processor where the user types commands. It is a shell or command lanuage interpreter for Unix-like operating systems, and it serves as the default shell for most Linux distributions and macOS.</p>
<p>Bash allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands, executing scripts, and managing file systems, providing features such as command-line editing, history, job control, and shell scription, making it a powerful tool for both interactive use and automation in the Unix environment.</p>
<p>Bash is an open source software and a widely used component of the Unix shell ecosystem.</p>
